# Core Language Compiler
### Find out more about this project <a href="https://loganflory.me/projects/core-compiler-project">here</a>
### P.S: If you're here from CSE3341, using this has a 90% chance to get you COAM'd because my repo is public. Also note that this is the final version of the compiler. Feel free to use this for inspiration if you get stuck or want to see how to solve a particular problem with your own compiler.
### P.S.S: If you're here from the CSE department and would like me to change anything, please email me.
